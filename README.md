##Notes

I was interested in doing the webservice method task but I was not sure about what format it should take. In the past when I have done a similar task, I've used the api of a framework like Drupal, Wordpress or Slim PHP to receive a request at an endpoint with some data, do something with the data and return a response. With the task I was not that sure if you needed a working web service or not or just a method that does what is outlined in the task. I thought the other task allowed me to demonstate a wider range of skills with more options and a little less ambiguity as I didn't have much time / access to ask questions for clarity about the tasks.

I would use Bootstrap / Material design lite, SASS, Gulp, Bower workflow and jQuery / HTML5 validation for the 'site' task, but as you specified only HTML, CSS and JS, I aimed to stick to the basics. 

# Skills test

This is short skills test, it's nothing too intesive but is designed to give creative freedom over how you approach a task

### Before you begin

1. Fork this repository so you have your own working copy

### Then do one of the following

Either

*A)* In the 'site' directory, mock up the provided PDF design in HTML, CSS and JS. Extra points for validation.

Or

*B)* In the 'api' directory, write a webservice method that accepts Northings and Eastings, converts them to Lat/Long and reverse geocodes to an address, outputing the result as XML or JSON (or both!)

Remember you only need to complete one of the tasks.

### Finally

We want to see your results so to submit your work:

1. Commit and push your code to your own repository
1. Send us a pull request with your result

Happy coding and good luck!
